# Python-Machine-Learning-project

Developed a machine learning model for cervical cancer prediction, performing data preprocessing and employing
classification algorithms and ensemble learning techniques.

Utilized various feature engineering techniques and hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance and ensure
robust predictions.

Achieved 99\%  accuracy with the proposed XGBoost model, optimizing for early detection of cervical cancer.
